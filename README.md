Ingredients
===========
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1 egg
* 1 cup brown sugar (light)
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup butter
* Chocolate chips

Step 1
======
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt together in one bowl. Whisk well for 45-60 seconds.

Step 2
======
1. Combine both sugars into one bowl that can handle hot butter for the next part. It is not necessary to mix the sugars yet.
2. Melt butter on stove top until it is all liquid, then transfer the liquid butter to the bowl with the sugars.
3. Crack the egg into the bowl with sugars and put your vanilla extract in as well.
4. Whisk the contents of the bowl until it is a relatively smooth consistency and all one color.

Step 3
======
1. Pour a small amount (~quarter cup; just eyeball it) of flour mixture into the sugar mixture.
2. Whisk this mixture until the flour is incorporated with the sugar mixture.
3. Repeat 1-2 until there is no flour left.
4. Pour your chocolate chips into the bowl and mix evenly.

Baking
======
1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees (I would recommend doing this right as you start step 3).
2. Lightly butter your baking tray (This is to help prevent the cookies from burning underneath).
3. Make small cookie spheres; I would start with making cookies that have a radius the size of the top of a coffee cup's radius.
4. Use plenty of chocolate chips in your cookies. About 50% cookie dough 50% chocolate to 60% cookie dough 40% chocolate is what I do usually, I think.
5. Line cookies in baking tray so they have about a half inch at least between each other.
6. Bake for 6 minutes, checking on them around 4-5 minutes. Once you start to see the bottom browning, be ready to take them out soon. They will burn quickly after you start seeing this.

Take-aways
==========
This is a recipe for slightly undercooked cookies that are very chewy and delicious. If you want less chewy cookies, I would recommend adding an egg and a 1/2 cup of flour to the mix. As you learn to bake these cookies, you will probably want to change measurements slightly to your preference and change cooking time depending on how they look and their size.
